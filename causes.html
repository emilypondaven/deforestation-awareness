      <li class="big"><b>Industrial agriculture</b></li>
      <p>According to Weeden (2020), industrial agriculture accounts for around 85% of deforestation worldwide. This is attributed to food production, including meat production (especially beef) as well as the production of soy and palm oil.</p>
      <br><br>
      <li class="big"><b>Timber logging</b></li>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, logging is a key contributor to deforestation as the global demand for wood products increasing. This accounts for around 60% od degradation worldwide (Weeden, 2020). Illegal and unsustainable logging is particularly on the rise in Brazil which is destroying nature, wildlife and communities.</p>
      <br><br>
      <li class="big"><b>Mining</b></li>
      <p>Industrial mining particularly in tropical forests like the Amazonian rainforest is ever increasing due to the rising demand and high mineral prices. </p>
      <br><br>
      <li class="big"><b>Expansion and infrastrucutre</b></li>
      <p>The rising human population is made space a necessity, which is facilitate by the cutting down of forests to provide more land for cities and settlements.This is a result of growing urbanisation around the world.</p>
      <br><br>
      <li class="big"><b>Climate change</b></li>
      <p>Instrestenly, climate change, an effect of deforestation, is likewise causing it. The extreme weathers like forest fires and storms that are caused by climate change (global warming in particular)  are destroying millions of forests each year. Itâ€™s harming the biodiversity and become is increasing threat.</p>
